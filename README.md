# Locating-Twitter-Users
Locating Twitter users accurately can be a very challenging and important task. In this project, we review existing literature of methods for locating users of Twitter using both the content they publish and their social network connections, and select three methods to implement and experiment. We report details of our data gathering and cleaning process as well as details of implementation and experiments of our adaptations of our chosen methods. We report the results we obtain from these experiments we've conducted, and discuss and analyze our findings.
